# euclib - Euclid SOC Python Libraries and Tools

This is a very simple set of packages and tools written in Python
for its usage in the Euclid mission SOC.

Please, note that this is a Python 3 code.  Compatibility with Python 2
is still ongoing, but is only considered as a nice-to-have.

This is still a work in progress.
